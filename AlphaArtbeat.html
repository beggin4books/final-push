  <h2> Medical </h2>
  <p class="content"> We included images of various medical supplies, like face masks,
    thermometers, hand sanitizer, and swabs in our mosaic, because these supplies
     became increasingly important as people tried to protect themselves from
     exposure to the virus. Once it was apparent that the coronavirus was a
     serious illness, people rushed to stores to stock up on toilet paper,
     paper towels, tissues, hand sanitizer, masks, and disinfectant.
     Supermarket shelves were left empty, and stores started to limit the
     number of items people could buy at one time. Citizens and companies
     alike worked to donate food, medical supplies, homemade masks, and other
     essential items. </p>

         is designed to be faster to build and easier to maintain than traditional ventilators, with a fraction of the parts. JPL engineers created the prototype specially
         targeted at COVID-19 patients in 37 days in March and April 2020." -NASA Image and Video Library, "Shipping NASA's Coronavirus Ventilator Prototype"</figcaption>

  <h2> Economic Issues </h2>
  <p class="content">The economic tolls of COVID-19 added another level of
    stress to an already uncertain situation with no clear answers in sight.
    Planes were grounded, shopping malls and streets were empty, and the stock
    market plunged like a cannonball. As university students, we face a poor
    job market after graduation. We hoped to use this project as a way to
    reflect on our experiences during this time. It is less obvious how we can
    display this environment through photos, so we included images of empty
    airports, empty buses, and a closed movie theater.  </p>
    <figure class="caption">
      <img src= "https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/710960858079166464/716808848379346974/IMG_3007.jpeg?width=878&height=1171" width="250"height="300" alt="figure">
      <figcaption> [Hannah] "I took this picture at the grocery store with my dad, when things were starting to become serious for lockdowns in the U.S. I took a picture,
        because the entire toilet paper/paper towel section was cleared out. This was even before masks were mandatory, and I was shocked that everyone had bought everything already!""</figcaption>
   </figure>
  <h2> Polictical Issues </h2>
  <p class="content">In this uncertain time, there were a variety of
    responses from governments across the world. Some implemented strict
    lockdowns quickly, while others delayed. Even within the U.S.,
    restrictions varied from state to state. As hospitals became
    overwhelmed by the influx of COVID-19 patients, and unemployment
    claims grew into the tens of millions, flaws in our fundamental
    institutions and systems were exposed. Though political issues can be
    difficult to approach and discuss, we knew they played a central role
    in the spread and effects of the virus. That is why we included two of
    Donald Trump's tweets in our mosaic, along with images of police officers
    enforcing lockdowns.   </p>
    <figure class="caption">
      <img src= "https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/710960858079166464/716810900354629663/trump2.png" width="600" height="288.5" >
      <figcaption> [Enakshi]: "This is a statement that Trump has tweeted. According to the LA Times, due to the virus, there has been a rise
        in hate crimes and fear against Asian Americans. As an Asian American, this type of behavior has caused me to feel apprehensive when
        the world already feels like it's falling apart."</figcaption>
   </figure>
  <h2> Isolation </h2>
  <p class="content"> This project was created for the International Space Apps
    challenge, and we were inspired by images of astronauts going into
    quarantine for a Saturn V launch. We were intrigued by the work NASA has
    done on the effects of isolation on people, and found that work particularly
    relevant in the current situation. As the coronavirus swept across the world
    and lockdowns were put into place, people found themselves at home, away
    from friends, family, and colleagues. In this new world of social distancing
     and staying inside, many had to deal with another effect of stay at home
     orders: isolation. In our mosaic, we wanted to include images which
     represented this collective isolation, and also how people found
     amusement and solace during this time. Within the mosaic, you can
     find people baking, going outside, and drawing. <br> </p>
     <figure class="caption">
       <img src= "https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/710960858079166464/716801397508538419/food.jpg" width="250" height="300" alt="figure">
       <figcaption> [Sam]: "This image is an experience sent in from someone whose travel to Korea experience consisted of a required
         covid test and a 14 day isolation period away from even his family. During this time, he could not leave the hotel room and had to dispose of
         all his waste in a biohazard bag. He recalled how there were even covid-positive and covid-negative elevators at the hotel."</figcaption>
    </figure>

  <h2> Environment </h2>
  <p class="content">With less cars on the road, and fewer planes in the sky,
    the positive effects on the natural world were a surprising silver
    lining during this outbreak. Wildlife appeared in strange places. With
    spring and summer approaching, we experienced more people taking walks
    outside, going on bike rides, and spending time in nature. For our mosaic, there
    are pictures of people enjoying the outdoors.  </p>
    <figure class="caption">
      <img src= "https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/710960858079166464/716801539360161842/samPhoto2.jpg?width=878&height=1171" width="250" height="300" alt="figure">
      <figcaption> [Sam] "My friend who is a  Michigan resident also recalled her experience going to a Metropark after the mandatory lockdown restrictions eased
        where the effects of pollution were seen in the beaches and waters. However, this time was different. The water seemed fresher, the air cleaner, and the
        animals were abundant."</figcaption>
